Hey! My name is Richard Galvez and I am currently a Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt and Fisk
University. I have quite a few varied interests including my research into cosmology / astrophysics / non-linear fluid
dynamics and data science, and you'll probably find related posts on this site regarding all sorts of random things.

You can check out my publications [here](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=find+a+galvez%2C+richard&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d)
if you're interested in my scientific work. 

Beyond that I generally enjoy researching topics in economics, sports statistics, and pretty
much anything that requires strict data analysis or hypothesis testing of some kind.

I also believe strongly that an open science policy helps out the progress of science as a whole-- so you'll also find
a lot of material on this blog and especially my github projects where I commit scientific suicide of giving away all of 
my dirty secrets on how I carry out my scientific research. I sincerely hope it helps someone out, especially if you're
just getting started.

I also use this blog to keep a scientific journal where I recap the day's research work and any thing eventful. I think
you'll find I'm a pretty boring guy!
