My name is Richard Galvez and I am currently a Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt and Fisk
University. I like to live on the boundary of astrophysics / cosmology and data science, often times diving further 
in either direction. The potential of machine learning / deep learning algorithms applied to large-scale cosmological 
and astrophysical surveys really drive me and my research. We're in a ripe time in the development of machine intelligence 
encountering unthinkable magnitudes of modern astrophysical surveys. It's a great time to be a scientist when we are not
exactly sure how deep learning algorithms learn, data is proliferating on all fronts and don't know what the particle nature of dark matter is. Waaay too many problems to look at..!

In the past, I've conducted research in turbulence within non-linear fluid dynamics, supersymmetric quantum field theory, the large N expansion of quantum field theory, inflation and super string theory. If you're interested in the technical details of this work, please check out my publications [here](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=find+a+galvez%2C+richard&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d).

Beyond that I generally just a ton of questions and I get a kick out of understanding something entirely and absolutely
unrelated to anything I've ever learned about. I like to believe that a scientist can investigate whatever problem
she or he deems interesting without regard to the norms in their field. I truly dislike the notion that one is
"wasting their time" if not working on a scientific paper. I don't believe the mind works that way in the least, 
and creativity should never be limited. 

I have drawn, on countless occassion, inspiration from entirely seemingly unrelated topics. Most recently
I've been learning about the subject of topological data analysis, which draws from my study of sting theory, differential
geometry and machine learning. It couldn't possibly be more interesting. You can read a nice review on the subject by 
Michael Lesnick (a mathematical biologist at the Institute for Advanced Study) [here](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/lesnick-topological-data-analysis).

The questions I am typically drawn to are mostly related to science, economics and sports statistics. You can find a 
menagerie of random questions I'm trying to answer by checking out [my GitHub](http://www.github.com/richardagalvez). 
I also try to keep a (somewhat descriptive) account of what I'm up to through jupyter notebooks in various repositories
(which I'm a big fan of) and a research blog which I update on regular occassion (mostly seems like more philosophical
thoughts rather than actual research). My blog can be found on this site.

# Guiding Philosophies

I am guided by a short list of principles in my every day life, and they are:

- Racism, discrimination and opression have no place in the modern world. All people, regardless of position, age, sex, origin, sexual orientation or any other factor should be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve for their unique talents, abilities and/or knowledge.

Of course, this is sadly currently not the case. However, I vow to fight this in everything I do. If you are a person that 
subscribes to views that not all people are created equal, or you think that fighting these problems are a waste of time,
please don't bother wasting *my* time.

- Open Science: I firmly adopt an open science policy.

Open Science concerns itself with the transparent sharing of knowledge and findings without concern
of theft of ideas. Thinkers can't help but to have ideas, they just happen-- most of the trouble lies in 
the execution. Sharing of ideas openly only helps the body of science and knowledge advance faster and I try to be 
as transparent as possible. Of course, within practical limitations. If a collaborator or client doesn't wish for me to share their secrets, I won't. If I am trying to advance my career at some given moment with sensitive results, I will probably
wait until I publish a paper. Sorry, but I have to be realistic also-- in a perfect world, I wish to not have to worry about
this. I still try to find related applications that illustrate concepts and difficulties I am facing to discuss progress. For example, I am currently using the medium of an [NFL Prediction Analysis](http://www.github.com/richardagalvez/nflanalysis)
algorithm as a decoy for a much larger and more ambitious project which shares the same analytical difficulties. 

I also aim to upload material that accompanies my scientific papers explaining 
the computational code, full derivation of formulae and/or data generated / analyzed in a github repo. I think this 
is especially helpful for beginners-- I do not wish to leave any derivations "left to the reader" unless the reader wishes to
do so. I have so far only done this with my most recent paper, but intend on creating repos for my previous papers also.

- Access to quality knowledge and educational resources will lead to a better world.

I also believe the world will be a much safer and progressive place if more people have access to quality
educational resources and scientifically valid information. Let those, whoever they are, or where ever they may be, have access to the resources necessary to answer the questions that drive their curiousity. This is why I am a huge fan of
Google's Project Loon. From [their website](https://www.solveforx.com/loon/):

>*"More than half of the world's population is still without Internet access. Project Loon is a network of balloons traveling >on the edge of space, designed to extend Internet connectivity to people in rural and remote areas worldwide."*

- In mentorship, I will never *ever* see a student entering industry as a failure, never, under any circumstance(s), ever.

I whole heartedly, with every fiber of my being, strongly dislike the sentiment in academia (specifically STEM fields) 
that moving to industry is seen as a *failure*. I believe this notion is extremely short sighted and damaging, not only to the exceptional student, but to science as a whole. If I mentored a student who was hired at Apple, Google, or Amazon, I would be
exceptionally *proud* and would love to keep contact with this brilliant person.

- Scientists and Engineers should see the explanation of their work to the public as a civic duty. 

Personally, I think there will be many who will disagree in having time to do this, but I doubt many will disagree with the
principle. Communication of one's work is key to inspire new generations and in ultimately resolving questions of the day.
For this reason I try to explain my work, to as large an audience as possible, on any occasion I have. I'm happy to have the
opportunity to give a Ted talk on dark matter November 13, 2016 for this reason.
