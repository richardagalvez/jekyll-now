<img align="right" hspace="50px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardagalvez/richardagalvez.github.io/master/meeeee.jpg" style="width: 250px;"/>My name is Richard Galvez and I am currently a Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge 
Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt and Fisk University. I live to understand how deep learning algorithms learn and what makes up dark matter.  

Generally, my research lies on the boundary between astrophysics / cosmology and data science, where I 
often dive a bit further in either direction. I believe The potential of machine learning / deep learning algorithms applied to large-scale cosmological and astrophysical surveys have great research potential. 
We're living in just the right time where the developments of machine intelligence research 
is ready to meet the magnitude of data coming from modern astrophysical surveys. It's a great time to be a scientist.

My research in the past has focused primarily in computational and mathematical physics / fluid dynamics. 
I've conducted research in non-linear fluids, supersymmetric quantum field theory, lattice field theory, the large N expansion of quantum field theories, cosmological inflation and super string theory. 

If you're interested in the technical details of this work, please check out my publications on 
[the Arxiv](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=find+a+galvez%2C+richard&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d).

Beyond that I generally just like to ask a ton of questions and I really enjoy communicating my understanding. I enjoy learning about new subjects I know nothing about and always welcome new 
challenges. I believe that a scientist can investigate whatever problem
she or he deems interesting without regard to the norms in their field. I truly dislike the notion that one 
is "wasting their time" if not working on a scientific paper directly related to their previous work. 
I don't believe the mind works that way in the least and try not to not limit my creativity.

I have drawn, on countless occasion, inspiration from entirely seemingly unrelated topics. For example, I've recently been learning about topological data analysis, which draws from my study of sting theory, differential
geometry and machine learning. It couldn't possibly be more interesting. You can read a nice review on the subject by 
Michael Lesnick (a mathematical biologist at the Institute for Advanced Study) [here](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/lesnick-topological-data-analysis).

The questions I am typically drawn to are mostly related to science, economics and sports statistics. You can find a 
menagerie of random questions I'm trying to answer by checking out [my GitHub](http://www.github.com/richardagalvez). 
I also try to keep a (somewhat descriptive) account of what I'm up to through jupyter notebooks in various repositories
(which I'm a big fan of) and a research blog which I update on regular occasion (mostly seems like more philosophical
thoughts rather than actual research :) ). My blog can be found on this site.

# Guiding Philosophies

I am guided by a short list of principles in my every day life and they are:

Racism, discrimination and oppression have no place in the modern world. 

All people, regardless of position, age, sex, origin, sexual orientation or any other factor should be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve for their unique talents, abilities and/or knowledge.

Of course, this is sadly currently not the case. I put a lot of my effort on a daily basis to fight for equality. Regardless if I continue in academia, move on to industry or policy, I'm very passionate about instituting change in the direction of proper equality and would love to find teammates.

2. Open Science.

Open Science concerns itself with the transparent sharing of knowledge and findings. Thinkers can't help but to have ideas, they just happen-- most of the trouble lies in 
the execution. Sharing of ideas openly only helps the body of science and knowledge advance faster and I try to be 
as transparent as possible.

I also aim to upload material that accompanies my scientific papers explaining 
the computational code, full derivation of formulae and/or data generated / analyzed in a Github repo. I think this 
is especially helpful for beginners-- I do not wish to leave any derivations "left to the reader" unless the reader wishes to
do so. I have so far only done this with my most recent paper, but intend on creating repos for my previous papers also.

3. Access to quality knowledge and educational resources will lead to a better world.

I also believe the world will be a much safer and progressive place if more people have access to quality
educational resources and scientifically valid information. Let those, whoever they are, or where ever they may be, have access to the resources necessary to answer the questions that drive their curiosity. This is why I am a huge fan of
Google's Project Loon. From [their website](https://www.solveforx.com/loon/):

*"More than half of the world's population is still without Internet access. Project Loon is a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space, designed to extend Internet connectivity to people in rural and remote areas worldwide."*

4. In mentorship, I will never *ever* see a student entering industry as a failure, never, under any circumstance(s), ever.

I whole heartedly, with every fiber of my being, strongly dislike the sentiment in academia (specifically STEM fields) 
that moving to industry is seen as a *failure*. I believe this notion is extremely short sighted and damaging, not only to the exceptional student, but to science as a whole. If I mentored a student who was hired at Apple, Google, or Amazon, I would be
exceptionally *proud* and would love to keep contact with this brilliant person.

5. Scientists and Engineers should see the explanation of their work to the public as a civic duty. 

Communication of one's work is key to inspire new generations and in ultimately resolving questions of the day.
For this reason I try to explain my work, to as large an audience as possible, on any occasion I have. I'm happy to have the
opportunity to give a Ted talk on dark matter November 13, 2016 for this reason. I’ll be placing a link here when done!

That’s about it! I try to never preach but let these principles guide my actions to later speak for themselves.

I also like to get pictures of myself doing handstands in iconic places around the world: <img align="right" hspace="50px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardagalvez/richardagalvez.github.io/master/IMG_4510.JPG" style="width: 250px;"/> More to come!
