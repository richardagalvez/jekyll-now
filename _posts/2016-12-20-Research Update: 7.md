Well, I haven't updated in quite some time, been extremely busy with many applications and papers, but glad to be back! 

After applications for various positions I've applied for and also after my TedX talk was finally completed, I decided to take
a nice relaxing break. Well, relaxing until I was bored and started working again. But, regardless, I've definitely been taking
it easy for about two weeks. After holidays I'm anticipating getting things rolling again, but for right now for Christmas and
New Year's, still pretty happy to coast a little more. There are three papers just in the oven that I would like to
complete soon (plus the requests for publication for another article) so I'll probably get started on that soon.

For the time being though, just relaxxxiinnnngggggg :).
