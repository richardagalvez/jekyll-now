# October 18, 2016: Thoughts on Hankel functions, BBN, waterfall mechanisms in inflation and the NFL.

Today was a pretty busy day. Started out the morning by working with graduate students who I tutor 
biweekly on math methods. They have an exam coming up this Friday and are pretty nervous about it. 
I'm glad I somehow still remember all sort of random orthonormality conditions for obscure special functions..!

## Thoughts on BBN

After that had a million meetings as usual and discussed some pretty interesting approaches on resolving
the Lithium problem with my colleague Bob Scherrer here at Vanderbilt University. The Lithium Problem 
interests me greatly. It seems like a rather well-posed theoretical problem in a time when theoretical physics
has seem to go off the deep end (see the waterfall mechanism for multifield inflation.. more on that later). 
For those who aren't familiar, the current big bang theory on nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes, to remarkable 
precision what light elements and what fraction of them should be produced in the early Universe. Bob and
I wrote a paper on it recently where we allowed for their to be an extra neutrino during the time of BBN and
we follow it's ramifications. 

BBN works amazingly well. It tells us exactly how much of Helium 4, Hydrogen and Deuterium should be produced in the very early Universe. This is all based on nuclear physics theory, so extremely well understood physics that has been verified time and time again to amazing precision. Then, by observing clouds of gas that are extremely
far away, and of course back in time, we can check the predictions of BBN. All seems to work alright when you
check He-4 and deuterium, etc., but when you get to lithium you get a big problem. BBN predicts too much lithium,
more than we see in low-metalicity stars, by about a factor of 3-5, depending who you ask (btw, you have to 
measure the lithium abundance in stars in our galaxy that have a low metal content, this tells you the 
chemical constrituents are still in their primordial form).

So we were talking about this problem and we were hypothesizing what are the only possibilities that could 
resolve the issue. I wouldn't want to give the punch line away here, but we think we're onto something. Before I move on from BBN though, I wonder if there are more elements that disagree highly with BBN predictions. Is it
really *just* a lithium problem, or do we have a BBN problem? The issue is that whatever processess help fix
this issue may also affect chemical abundances of other elements.. and well, we have to cross-validate there
as well. Can't just somehow fix lithium and mess other elements up (which is what most people end up doing 
when they try fixing the lithium problem).

In either case, I think taking a close look at the Lithium Problem should reveal some interesting new 
break throughs in physics. Anyway, that's why I've been focusing my attention so much on that lately.

## Waterfall Mechanism in multifield inflation

I'm pretty upset with the state of research in inflation. I don't mean to upset those who are researching that
field, but I came across a paper today on primordial black holes and how they can be produced with the so-called waterfall mechanism. Effectively, this mechanism divides the 60 or so e-folds of inflation (how many times we 
need the universe to exponentially expand to solve the horizon problem) into two phases: I and II. In phase I
the usual slow roll inflaton field dominates the expansion and then suddenly, for no known reason, a second 
field takes over and drives the rest of inflation. Both of these fields of course have very different dynamics
which seems quite fortunate, since now you can do all of the things you wish you could do in multifield 
inflation sans the problems with introducing non-gaussianities (this is the phenomena that contributes 
non-gaussian effects to the otherwise perfectly gaussian CMB).

So of course there are tunable parameters in this inflationary potential, and the authors of this paper (which 
I'll just omit here) pick these parameters perfectly to get primordial black holes of just the right mass. 
I was asked to read and present this paper for a research group that does mostly galaxy simulations, so they
wanted to know if it was something they should take with credence. Conclusion: NO.

## NFL Analysis

I recently decided it might be interesting to attempt to use machine learning techniques to predict success at
the NFL level. See my github project NFLAnalysis for more information. Interestingly, probowl voting is ongoing
and I would love to have some predictions before we know for sure who is sent to the probowl.

Today I got an extremely random forests classifier algorithm to predict 4 probowl quarterbacks! Graph to come soon below. It guessed 6 wrong however, but I think I could live with that. At the end of the day, you only need to get this right once.
