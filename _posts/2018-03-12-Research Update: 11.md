title: Back again after a long hiatus
---

It's been almost an entire year since I've updated my blog-- and my has it been eventful. Ever since I last posted here, I completely an industry internship at one of the largest data science teams in the industry (Stitch Fix), and accepted a fellowship at the NYU Center for Data Science and NYU Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics. During this time, I moved from Nashville, spent three great months living in San Francisco and then moved to New York City (Greenwich Village). I've also gotten into online data science competitions, started a data science consulting side gig, and think my colleague and I maybe think we possibly, maybe maybe figured out what dark matter is(?) or at least what some of it could be. It's pretty safe to say life is going pretty well.

In this time I've also learned a great deal more about data science in industry and academia alike, and am looking forward to writing tutorial posts on some of the more nuanced details I've learned along the way. Since I like to have at least one plot per post, here's a figure I recently put together for the analysis of one of the online competitions I am currently involved in, which you can read about more [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/52/anomaly-detection-electricity/):

The competition is quite interesting in the sense that you are given quite a lot of usage data and asked to not only feature engineer, but also label data. The main concern of the company sponsoring the competition is to have a robust algorithm that can detect anomalies in power consumption in buildings. The figure above has the meter readings in one of the buildings as a time series, and the outer bands depict the 3 sigma Bollinger bands in the 2 week averaged data.

In terms of online competitions, I have spent most of my time involved in competitions hosted by quantopian.com and numer.ai, but now I am more interested in focusing on those hosted on drivendata.org since they pose ambiguous problems with the overall goal of helping humanity by addressing the world's largest current issues, in this case, reducing power consumption to ameliorate the onset of climate change. Because I am involved in these competitions, I'll probably wait until they are done to share all of my secrets :).
