title: About me, boosted trees and heavy late decaying particles
-----
Well today I don't think I'll write much since I spent about an hour (!) writing my about me section.
I spent sometime on it, mostly outlining my values and views on various things, so please, read
it!

# Elements of statistical learning. 

I spent sometime reading up on ESL today.
It's definitely one of my favorite texts. Found some pretty interesting explanations and 
examples for the boosted trees algorithm. As far as I understand boosted trees currently,
it relies on building a master estimator from multiple weak estimators. I'll hate to write
more about this later as I continue to learn about this algorithm. 

ESL however is one of my favorite texts. As a mathematical physicist research machine learning,
I've really become annoyed with oversimplified explanations online that omit mathematical rigor.
People try to make subjects more accessible, but honestly the just mix up something that could
be eloquently stated in it's mathematical form. ESL is this for those with a strong background
in maths. All other, 'hello world' just make things way too complicated with weird analogies.
If you're a theoretical physicist or anyone with a background in math, just go right for
Elements of Statistical Learning. I can't state enough how awesome this book is.

# Decay of heavy scalars before BBN

Well, I've researched this before, but not in the current context my colleague and friend Bob Scherrer
are currently considering it. In the past I considered this idea to explain the genesis of dark matter
with a heavy scalar decaying to various decay products including a weakly interacting massive particle
or *WIMP*. This time we're looking at phenomenological consequences of a different type.. I'll have to 
leave the reader in suspense though :).

# TedX slides are done..

Except the American Museum of Natural History did not give me permission to use an awesome video they
put together depicting the scale of the Universe. It's such a shame too-- it's quite a great video.
Check out digital universe amnh in google (currently on vim and too lazy to get link..). 

I understand there are licensing issues, but I question their decision-- this is for educational 
purposes. Oh well, it's no big deal, I'll figure out an alternative!

-- That is all, sleep time!
